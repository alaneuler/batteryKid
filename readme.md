To [prolong Li-ion based 
batteries](https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/):

> Do not use the battery fully, and do not leave the battery at 100% for 
an extended period of time. The best operating environment for Li-ion 
batteries is between 30% and 80% power.

However, for those who're using MacBooks as their daily workhourse, chances 
are that the batteries are always 100% for a long period of time.

This tiny menu bar tool can help you keep the battery in your MacBook in a healthier state. Supports currently only Application Silicon. It has two modes:
1. Lite Mode (Recommended): this mode maintains the SoC (State of Charge) in user selected value (Â±2).
2. Pro Mode: this mode exposes the switchs underneath the lite mode.
   - Charging switch
   - Power source (AC) switch

> Note: After toggling the charging switch, it may take some time (about 20 seconds or so) for built-in battery status to change. Your battery is in fact already in charging state or non-charging state.

## Disclaimer
I do not take any responsibility for any sort of damage in result of using 
this tool! Although it had no negative side effects for me, 
macOSBatteryManager still taps in some very low level system functions 
that are not meant to be tampered with (private APIs).

**Use it at your own risk!**
